Pre-compiled mysql binary
========================

As heroku doesn't compile mysql binaries. This is a set of mysql binaries, that's compiled in cedar-14 to use with [heroku-mysql-buildpack](https://github.com/gaumire/heroku-mysql-buildpack) for herkou apps that require use of a mysql binary on the dyno itself.
